Test project of node/mongo easy to share crypted data

First project using NodeJS or MongoDB.

The idea is to be able to create a small data reposotiry quickly and easily and to be able to share the data with a simple ID and secret key to decrypt.
Write message on an existing repository is only possible if the client has the private key to sign its messages.
